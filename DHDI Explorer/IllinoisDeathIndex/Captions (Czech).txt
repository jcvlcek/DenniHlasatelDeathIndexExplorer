From www.scintilla.org/locale.de.properties
# Also from http://interval.cz/clanky/adobe-photoshop-6-prehled-klavesovych-zkratek/

# locale.properties defines the localised text for the user interface
# Some definitions are commented out because they duplicate another string
# The format of each line is original=localised, such as File=&Fichier
# Even though the original text may have ellipses "..." and access key
# indicators "&" in the user interface, these do not appear in this file
# for the original texts. Translated texts should have an access key indicator
# if needed as the translated text may not include the original access key.
# Ellipses are automatically added when needed.
# The "/" character should not be used in menu entries as on GTK+ the "/" is
# used to specifiy the menu hierarchy and so will produce extra menu items.
# Each original text may have only one translation, even if it appears in
# different parts of the user interface.

# Please state any further license conditions and copyright notices you desire.
# If there are no further notices then contributed translations will be assumed
# to be made freely available under the same conditions as SciTE.
# Email addresses included in this file may attract spam if the file is published.

# Define the encoding of this file so that on GTK+ 2, the file can be
# reencoded as UTF-8 as that is the GTK+ 2 user interface encoding.
# A common choice for European users is LATIN1. For other locales look at
# the set of encodings supported by iconv.

(1) Automatically detect the data files folder on startup, if it is beneath the project folder

(2) Make the database connection on demand (menu item, etc) rather than automatic

(3) Create a names generator, to make up sample data that can be publicly available

(4) Make all non-ASCII data UTF-8 - includes renaming database columns / properties as needed

(5) Create a "details" page on each hit in the Denni Hlasatel index (rather than having the link point to kdejsme)
	The details page should expand to show everything that can be calculated about the decedent:
	All forms of the name
	Male or female (with[out] diacriticals, with[out] -ova endings, etc.)
	Link first / last names to kdejsme.cz if possible
	Death reporting date
	Links to any matches in the Illinois death index
	Social Security Account Number (SSAN) when possible

(6) Create a form for entering (as UTF-8) all the cases of a name - to enable group-sourcing the collection
